# File Formats

This project has been made to open, read and/or create files from uncommon formats found within various games or software.

## What we can do for now

We cannot do much, but here's what's available.

Idea Factory's File Formats :
* Read and extract .PAC
* Read, extract and create .CL3
* Convert .TID to common picture formats and common picture format to .TID.

## What has yet to be done

We still have a long way to go ! Here's what we need to do :
* Create new .PAC (uncompressed for now)
* Fix DXT compression for .TID
* Test everything

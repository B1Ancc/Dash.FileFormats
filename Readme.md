# File Formats

This project has been made to open, read and/or create files from uncommon formats found within various games or software.

## What we can do for now

We cannot do much, but here's what's available.

Idea Factory's File Formats :
* Read, extract and create (uncompressed) .PAC
* Read, extract and create .CL3
* Convert .TID to common picture formats and common picture format back to .TID

## What has yet to be done

We still have a long way to go ! Here's what we need to do :
* Add compression support for .PAC
* Fix DXT1/5 compression for .TID which isn't working for an unknown reason
* Find an alternative to Neptoolia.Datalayer.Decompressor
* Test everything
